# Phase 1 — FSM Design & System Analysis

This phase focuses on analyzing the traffic light system and designing the finite state machine (FSM) that controls the behavior of the two traffic lights.

## 📘 Contents
- System analysis
- Moore vs. Mealy FSM justification
- State diagram
- State transition table

## 📄 File Included
- **Analysis_of_the_System.pdf**  
  Contains the complete system analysis and FSM design.

## 🎯 Summary
This phase establishes the foundation for the entire project by defining:
- The required states
- The transition conditions
- The outputs for each state
- The reasoning behind choosing a Moore machine for deterministic timing

This documentation guides the RTL implementation in Phase 2.
